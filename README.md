# Prioritize Now - Eisenhower Matrix Task Manager

The Eisenhower Matrix Task Manager is a web application designed to help you prioritize your tasks based on the principles of the Eisenhower Matrix. This method, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, categorizes tasks into four quadrants:

*   **Do:** Urgent and Important
*   **Decide:** Important but Not Urgent
*   **Delegate:** Urgent but Not Important
*   **Delete:** Neither Urgent nor Important

This tool helps you focus on what truly matters and delegate or eliminate tasks that don't align with your goals.
